# Welcome to our printf function!

This is our custom implementation of the C language printf function, written in C. It is designed to handle a wide range of conversion specifiers, including c, s, d, i, and b.

## Getting Started

To use this printf function in your C program, simply include the main.h header file in your source code.

## Supported Conversion Specifiers

Here is a list of the conversion specifiers that this printf function supports:

%c: character
%s: string
%d, %i: signed decimal integer
%b: binary integer

## Flags, Width, and Precision

This implementation does not support flags, width, or precision modifiers. If you need these features, you will need to modify the code accordingly.

## Credits

This implementation was created by IPFANI MULEYA & REGINALD ANIM.
